# ARTS Framework Counter Configuration
# =====================================
# 
# Format: COUNTER_NAME=captureMode[,captureLevel]
#
# captureMode (required):
#   OFF      - Counter disabled
#   ONCE     - Single value captured at the end (no periodic capture)
#   PERIODIC - Periodic capture during execution
#
# captureLevel (optional, default: NODE):
#   THREAD   - Per-thread output (no reduction across threads)
#   NODE     - Per-node output (reduce values across threads)
#   CLUSTER  - Per-cluster output (reduce values across all nodes)
#
# Examples:
#   edtRunningTime=OFF              # Disabled
#   edtRunningTime=ONCE             # Single value at end, NODE level (default)
#   edtRunningTime=ONCE,NODE        # Single value at end, NODE level (explicit)
#   edtRunningTime=ONCE,THREAD      # Single value at end, per-thread output
#   edtRunningTime=PERIODIC         # Periodic capture, NODE level (default)
#   edtRunningTime=PERIODIC,THREAD  # Periodic capture, per-thread output
#   edtRunningTime=PERIODIC,NODE    # Periodic capture, per-node output
#
# Edit this file to configure counters, then re-run: cmake

# Counters - Event counting and timing
# =============================================================================

# EDT (Event-Driven Task) Counters
edtRunningTime=OFF
numEdtsCreated=OFF
numEdtsAcquired=OFF
numEdtsFinished=OFF

# DB (Data Block) Counters
numDbsCreated=OFF

# Memory Counters
memoryFootprint=OFF

# Remote Counters
remoteBytesSent=OFF
remoteBytesReceived=OFF

# =============================================================================
# Twin-Diff Optimization Counters
# =============================================================================
# Track twin-diff protocol effectiveness
twinDiffUsed=OFF                 # Count of times twin-diff was computed
twinDiffSkipped=OFF              # Count of times twin-diff was skipped (high dirty ratio)
twinDiffBytesSaved=OFF           # Total bytes saved by sending diffs vs full DB
twinDiffComputeTime=OFF          # Total microseconds spent computing diffs

# =============================================================================
# Acquire-Mode Override Counters
# =============================================================================
# Track acquire-mode override effectiveness
acquireReadMode=OFF              # Count of READ mode acquisitions
acquireWriteMode=OFF             # Count of WRITE mode acquisitions
ownerUpdatesSaved=OFF            # Count of owner updates avoided via READ override
ownerUpdatesPerformed=OFF        # Count of owner updates performed

# =============================================================================
# ARTS ID Tracking Counters (for ArtsMate integration)
# =============================================================================
# Track performance metrics per arts_id (compiler-assigned unique identifier)
# This enables linking compile-time metadata with runtime performance data
artsIdEdtMetrics=OFF             # Per-arts_id EDT aggregate metrics (hash table)
artsIdDbMetrics=OFF              # Per-arts_id DB aggregate metrics (hash table)
artsIdEdtCaptures=OFF            # Per-arts_id EDT detailed captures (ArrayList)
artsIdDbCaptures=OFF             # Per-arts_id DB detailed captures (ArrayList)

# =============================================================================
# Per-Node Timing Counters
# =============================================================================
# Track high-level timing for the ARTS runtime phases
# These are captured once at the end and aggregated at NODE level
initializationTime=ONCE,NODE     # Time spent in ARTS initialization phase
endToEndTime=ONCE,NODE           # Total end-to-end execution time
finalizationTime=ONCE,NODE       # Time spent in ARTS finalization/shutdown phase
