# ARTS Framework Counter Configuration
# Format: COUNTER_NAME=MODE
# MODE can be: OFF, ONCE, THREAD, or NODE
#   OFF    - Counter disabled
#   ONCE   - Print counter values at the end (single output)
#   THREAD - Capture each thread's counters without reduction (per-thread output)
#   NODE   - Capture and reduce counters per node (per-node output)
# Edit this file to configure counters, then re-run: cmake
