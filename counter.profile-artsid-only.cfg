# ARTS counter profile: arts_id attribution (minimal)
#
# Goal: attribute runtime work/bytes to compiler-assigned `arts_id` with
# minimal disruption, while still reporting a few node-level totals needed to
# compute coverage and basic overhead ratios.
#
# Enable by configuring ARTS with:
#   cmake .. -DCOUNTER_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/external/arts/counter.profile-artsid-only.cfg
#
# Notes:
# - `artsId*Metrics=THREAD` emits per-thread JSON (`counterFolder/n0_t*.json`).
# - Keep captures OFF unless you explicitly need per-invocation traces.
