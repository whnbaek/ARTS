# ARTS counter profile: deep per-invocation tracing (heavy)
#
# Goal: collect per-invocation `arts_id` traces with timestamps to debug
# variance, imbalance, and critical path effects.
#
# Enable by configuring ARTS with:
#   cmake .. -DCOUNTER_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/external/arts/counter.profile-deep.cfg
#
# Warning:
# - `artsId*Captures` can allocate and push a lot of trace records.
# - Use small problems / short runs and keep this separate from performance
#   experiments.
